# Dealer Adapt API (Capstone Project - Mohawk College)

This project is the **backend API** for *Dealer Adapt*, a capstone software development project completed during my final (6th) semester at **Mohawk College** between **September and December 2024**.

Dealer Adapt API provides a comprehensive set of **RESTful endpoints** for managing automotive dealership operations, including inventory, customer records, and sales transactions. It is built using **ASP.NET Core** and is designed to integrate seamlessly with frontend clients and external services.
